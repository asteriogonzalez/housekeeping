The aim os this project is to save all the knowledge needed for installing and setup a linux working environment in form os automatic installation procedures.

The goals are:

- DRY.
- Save time in maintenance operations.

The project uses Fabric to specify and automate configurations.

Each folder contains specific files that are needed outside the official package (as licenses or code patches) when is needed.

- Working environment: Sublime 3, WingIDE, python tools, etc.
- Editing and publishing tools: pelican, markdown, etc.
- Propietary drivers: NVIDIA cards, etc.
- Web browsers: Opera, Vivaldi and Chrome.
